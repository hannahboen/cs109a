    "We see that there are certain absolute and/or simple majorities present in each explored variable of interest. Females are the absolute majority sex, college graduates are the simple majority education level, and whites (non-Hispanics) are the absolute majority imputed race. While it is possible to resample the data and create a balanced dataset, we decided not to resample the data at this time in order to maintain the representativeness and interpretability of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, there is a slightly larger percentage of females than males in the USA and the US Census Bureau estimated that the USA was ~75% white in 2022 which aligns with the percentages on our graphs. The aim is to reflect real-world demographics and ensure that our findings are applicable to broader populations. By not artificially balancing the data, we preserve the natural variations in demographic factors. We will instead address these imbalances by ensuring that each class is adequately represented in both training and testing sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "The line graphs depicting percentages of sex, education, and imputed race variables of interest consistently show similar patterns over the five-year period, appearing as horizontal lines for each response. The stability in these percentages raises questions about potential data calculation errors or variations in data collection methods. Given the relatively short timeframe and minimal reported changes in data collection processes, it is possible that these findings reflect the consistent nature of these demographic attributes throughout the five-year span. This is something we will further analyze in future work.\n"

    "The BRFSS uses *data weighing* to make its sample more representative of the adult population of the United States. Its weighing methodology comprises of a **design weight** that compensates for an individuals' probability of selection and a **demographic adjustment** to weight under-or-over sampled populations towards their true population proportion/importance with iterative proportional fitting or raking. Each year contains new weights calculated for that year's survey, most notably an updated **_LLCPWT** weight for the Combined Land Line and Cell Phone data. This weight contains the required significance scaling for each observation based on their demographics and representation in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a memo accompanying the 2021 BRFSS data, [Complex Sampling Weights and Preparing Module Data for Analysis](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2021/pdf/Complex-Sampling-Weights-and-Preparing-Module-Data-for-Analysis-2021-508.pdf), \"Researchers conducting analysis of variables from the core-only section should use the variable _LLCPWT for weighting\" (CDC 2021:2). As our analysis relies primarily on variables generated by questions from the core-only section, we will be utilizing _LLCPWT."
